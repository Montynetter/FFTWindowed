This code processes a signal and calculates its frequency spectrum using Welch's method with a sliding window approach. It then plots the frequency spectrum for each window and saves each plot as an image. It also plots the dependence of the frequency and amplitude of the maximum peak on the window number and saves these plots as images.

To use this code, you need to provide the path to the input file containing the signal data in the format of two columns of time and current. You also need to specify the path to the output folder where the plots will be saved. The number of windows and the window size are determined based on the length of the signal and the desired number of windows. The code uses the scipy.signal.welch function to calculate the spectrum for each window and numpy functions to store the frequency and amplitude data for each window. The matplotlib library is used to plot and save the graphs.
